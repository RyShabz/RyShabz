### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm [Ryan]

I work as a Data PM and Scientist for a large utility in Los Angeles. Helping push the industry forward in the area of advanced data analytics.

I have a passion for using data to help drive businesses past their goals. 

### ðŸŒ± What I'm focusing on

Currently improving my Python skills to leverage mostly for data science but also expanding my awareness of available libraries
Current personal project is a discord.py bot to refresh my python skills.

### ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving predictive analytics 

- Utility world is preferred, but open to other fields. Healthcare is very enticing.
- Use energy consumption data to profile customer habits.
